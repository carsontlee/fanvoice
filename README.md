## FanVoiceApp

### Overview

FanVoiceApp is a Python-based application designed to allow users to interact with AI-generated voices. Users can select from various voice options, input text, and have the application generate speech in the chosen voice. This project leverages AI and machine learning technologies to create realistic and customizable voice outputs.

### Features

*   **Voice Selection**: Users can choose from a variety of pre-existing voice options.
*   **Text Input**: Users can input any text they wish to have spoken.
*   **Speech Generation**: The application uses AI to generate speech from the input text in the selected voice.
*   **Audio Output**: The generated speech can be played back or downloaded as an audio file.

### Technologies Used
